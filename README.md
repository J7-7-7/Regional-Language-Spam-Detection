# Regional-Language-Spam-Detection

Developing an SMS spam detection system for a regional language such as Hindi presents a myriad of challenges. Unlike widely-researched languages like English, resources for Hindi are less abundant, which can make data collection and preprocessing daunting tasks. High-quality labeled datasets, essential for training efficient deep learning models, might be scarce or entirely non-existent, requiring tremendous efforts in manual annotation. Furthermore, nuances in regional linguistic variations, colloquialisms, and idiomatic expressions in Hindi make the preprocessing steps like tokenization and stemming complex. However, despite these hurdles, the importance of such a system cannot be overstated. As digital communication grows exponentially in India, ensuring a spam-free experience for Hindi-speaking users becomes paramount. Effective spam filters in regional languages not only protect users from potential scams but also enhance the user experience, affirming the language's significance in the digital landscape
